# Page View Time Series Visualizer

Instructions for building the project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer
This project visualizes time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. It uses Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations help understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
